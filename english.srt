1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,820
This world is filled with dungeons.

2
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,760
It is said that some of them even have
perilous labyrinths that thwart adventurers.

3
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,380
Undiscovered.

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,550
Untrodden.

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,300
Unreachable.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,040
People called these places rich in mystery...

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,610
hidden dungeons!

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,500
Welcome...

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,080
Come forth, brave one.

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,250
I await you on the second floor.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
This way.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,100
This way.

13
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,690
#01 "Powerful Skill Set"

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,760
I, Noir Stardia,
am the third son of a noble.

15
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,180
After graduating from the
Jastal Preparatory School,

16
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,890
I decided to pursue a career
instead of higher education.

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,620
Today was supposed to be
my first day on the job, but...

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,730
Father? Mother? What's wrong?

19
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,840
Well, that library you're
supposed to work at...

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,870
Yes, today's my first day.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,110
Actually, the viscount's son interfered,

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,200
and you won't be able to work there after all.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Huh?

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,880
Aristocratic Society

25
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,430
We may be nobles, but the Stardia
family only held a baronetcy.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,130
Baronet

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,130
Viscount

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,130
Baron

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,130
Earl

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,130
Marquess

31
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,130
Duke

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,430
Librarian

33
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,430
Baron

34
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,430
Viscount

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,430
Earl

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,430
Viscount

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,860
We're just poor nobles who stand no
chance against anyone ranked higher.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,730
Father, please raise your head.

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,950
I absolutely deplore you...
I mean, adore you, Father.

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,290
You totally meant the first part!

41
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,740
But I guess the real question is...
what do I do now?

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,230
You shitty father... I mean, Father.

43
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,620
You didn't even hesitate that time!
I felt that malice!

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,300
I feel your anger, my son!

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,190
I will not accept this!

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,420
Who is this fiend who took
my dearest brother's position?

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,890
I will go talk to them personally!

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,250
Alice, I appreciate it, but we're
talking about the son of a viscount.

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,210
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,280
But... that's simply not fair,
my dear brother!

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,640
I know! Why not take the exam
for the Hero Academy?

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,020
The Hero Academy, eh?

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,610
Those who graduate from the Hero Academy
can become monster hunters or royal knights.

54
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,180
Basically, you're set for life if you make it there.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,640
I'd never pass.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,460
You should at least try!

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,160
If you don't make it,
I'll take care of you myself!

58
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,910
Th-Thanks...

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,560
Noir!

60
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,490
Hey!

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,520
Morning!

62
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,620
Morning, Emma.

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,440
This is Emma Brightness.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,750
She was born into a barony,
meaning her family is wealthy,

65
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,700
but our parents are friends,

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,600
and she's been my friend since we were kids.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,580
We're both going to be
librarians starting today!

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,110
Let us do our best!

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,990
Actually, about that, Emma...

70
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,360
What?!

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,020
Th-Th-Then... you can't be a librarian?

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,480
No...

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,490
But...

74
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,490
Y-You're that disappointed?

75
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,890
Well, I mean...

76
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,610
I had some really good news!

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,090
About your skill.

78
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,760
Skill? You mean my Great Sage skill?

79
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,890
Skill [Great Sage]

80
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,320
The Great Sage skill
is my one and only skill.

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,890
Tells the user everything about the world
(even the unexplained).

82
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,270
It tells me everything about the world.

83
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,890
It's a pretty rare skill.

84
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,730
My parents jumped for joy when they
had my skill appraised at the church.

85
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,580
Fantastic, my son!

86
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,730
Oh, how wonderful!

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,560
But...

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,650
I can't use the Great Sage skill.

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,570
Q: What's tomorrow's
\h\h\h\hweather forecast?

90
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,570
Well, actually, I can...

91
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,570
A: It'll be sunny!

92
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,550
But every time I use it,

93
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm plagued with a headache
so bad that I wish for death.

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,260
Which is why I don't use it.

95
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,040
I just happened to be going through
the ancient texts yesterday,

96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,820
and I found this passage...

97
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,200
"Whenever the great sage of old, Marlin,
was plagued with terrible headaches,

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,280
he demanded kisses from his wives."

99
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,400
Why, though?

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
They must've been effective
against his headaches! Duh!

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
What?

102
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,140
Th-That makes sense, doesn't it?

103
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,030
Actually, you might have a point.

104
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,900
D-Do you want to give it a try?

105
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,240
Are you sure?

106
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,590
W-W-Well, who else are
you going to try that with?!

107
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,630
It's just a kiss! And we've known
each other forever...

108
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,520
And we're totally adults!

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,610
In that case...

110
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,410
Huh?!

111
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,870
W-Wait.

112
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,800
Let's find a better spot...

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,980
Y-You can go ahead.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,150
I hope you're ready.

115
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,960
You can do it!

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,900
Answer my query, Great Sage.

117
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,330
As you wish.

118
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,580
I want to become stronger so I can pass
the exam for the Hero Academy.

119
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,890
What's the most efficient way
to become stronger?

120
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,770
Explore a hidden dungeon.

121
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,520
A hidden dungeon? Where's the closest one?

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,670
There lies a cave 15,000 meters
southwest of here.

123
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,530
Activate the switch in the wall,
and you will find the Infinite Labyrin—

124
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,530
My head's killing me!

125
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,700
Should we kiss again?

126
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,830
Yes, please!

127
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,550
My headache's fading...

128
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,350
Does... your head still hurt?

129
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,260
Yeah.

130
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,610
I've got all the right gear.

131
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,870
I even borrowed a sword from Father.

132
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,220
Is this where the switch is?

133
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,140
You will need a spell to open the door.

134
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,230
And that spell is...

135
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,060
"Hidden dungeon only I can enter!

136
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,570
Let me train in secret to become
the strongest in the world!"

137
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,300
This way.

138
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,200
U-Um... You are alive, right?

139
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,490
Touch my head.

140
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,830
I am Olivia Servant!

141
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,880
I am Olivia Servant
a totally super-awesome adventurer

142
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,880
A totally super-awesome adventurer!

143
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,800
You see, I happened to stumble upon
this hidden dungeon on one of my walks.

144
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,590
I figured out how to get in all by myself.

145
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,720
I ran into a monster on the second floor
and decimated it in two seconds.

146
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Things were going peachy,

147
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,600
but then a trap activated.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,470
I've been tied up in here
for 200 years since then.

149
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,800
For 200 years?! I'll undo your restraints right—

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,740
Nope, hold it. These are special
chains called Death Chains.

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,360
Cut them and say bye-bye to Olivia.

152
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,030
Huh? Then why did you call me here?

153
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,340
I've been looking for someone to talk to.

154
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,800
I figured no one would ever hear me,
but you actually showed up!

155
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,030
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this moment!

156
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,480
Anyway, you must have real potential,
considering you found this dungeon.

157
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,920
What's your name?

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,470
It's Noir Stardia.

159
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,130
Noir, eh?

160
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,350
So what brought you here, anyway?

161
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,840
Well...

162
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,940
Right. I got you.

163
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,360
But I'm sure the Great Sage also said this!

164
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,520
"The super-hot babe Olivia
is sealed away in B2!"

165
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,870
Nope. He didn't say a word about you.

166
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,940
Well, whatever.
So you wanna get stronger, right?

167
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,520
Then you can have my skills.

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,370
Huh?

169
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,700
Well, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon...

170
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,760
So just tap your forehead against mine.

171
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,260
L-Like this?

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,700
Dun dun da-dun!

173
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,380
You've quite literally got skills,
Noir. Mine, that is.

174
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,590
Now I can die without any regrets.

175
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,270
Wait! You can't just die now!

176
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,460
Pfft. Like I'd actually die.

177
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,350
You can address me as "Master" from now on.

178
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,530
Now, I'll give you a simple
rundown of my skills.

179
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,790
The Get Creative skill.

180
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,860
You can create pretty much any
skill your mind can think of.

181
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,270
The Bestow skill.

182
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,000
You can give the skills you've
created to other people or objects.

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,790
Noir

184
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,790
Wings

185
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,310
The Editor skill.

186
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,250
Noir

187
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,250
Wings

188
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,810
You can edit the skills you've
given to yourself or others.

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,250

190
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,250
————

191
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:52,230
Skills

192
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:52,230
Get Creative

193
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,670
So... Get Creative, Bestow, and Editor.

194
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:52,230
Bestow

195
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:52,230
Editor

196
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,240
Depending on how I use these, I can
create insanely powerful attacks.

197
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,020
But be careful.

198
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,470
To use any of these skills,
you need life points, or LP.

199
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,940
Life Points

200
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,350
The stronger the skill,
the more LP it consumes,

201
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,820
Slow

202
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,820
Fast

203
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,700
so make sure you use LP
Conversion when that happens.

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,700
LP Conversion

205
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,510
LP Conversion?

206
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,810
If you do something that feels good,
your satisfaction gets turned into LP.

207
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,700
Huh?

208
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,670
For example, fulfilling your sexual desires.

209
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,160
Getting close with a charming
person of the opposite sex.

210
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,850
Then there's hunger.

211
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,660
Eating delicious foods and savoring
delicacies are both effective.

212
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,170
Finally, the desire for worldly things.

213
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,900
Earn that dough and spend it
like there's no tomorrow.

214
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,960
S-So you're telling me to be a hedonist.

215
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,120
Oh, FYI, if your LP reaches zero, you die.

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,590
Maybe tell me that first.

217
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,920
How much LP do you have right now?

218
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,270
Concentrate.

219
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,890
S-Sure.

220
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,610
Five hundred fifty.

221
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,740
Five hundred fifty, eh?
Why don't you give Get Creative a shot?

222
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,370
All right. Here I go.

223
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,040
Jiggle.

224
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,120
Jiggle.

225
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,610
Get Creative: Stone Bullet skill.

226
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,020
Skill

227
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,020

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,180
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.

231
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,680
Stone Bullet visualizes condensing dust
in the air in front of my hand...

232
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,340
and fires it!

233
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,770
I-I beat it...

234
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,610
But I'm kinda tired now.

235
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,420
I'm going to have to figure out how
to rake in that LP from now on.

236
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,610
But for today...

237
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,590
Oh, Big Brother!

238
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,670
Is my lap a comferble...
a comfortable pillow for you?

239
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,420
Man, I feel alive again.

240
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,230
Can I get a goodnight hug, too?

241
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,010
Huh?!

242
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,380
I'm so blessed to have such
a cute, kind little sister!

243
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,930
Noir Stardia

244
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,440
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.

245
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Sorry to keep you waiting, Noir.

246
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,640
S-Sorry to call you out of the blue.

247
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,140
No, it's fine. What did
you want to talk about?

248
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,820
I have a favor to ask.

249
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,970
Also, you seem a bit different today.

250
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,310
Y-You think so?

251
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,840
You're usually more reserved.

252
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,490
Well, everyone's always staring at my chest!

253
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,170
Of course I'd want to hide it.

254
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm not sure if that outfit is helping...

255
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,860
Well, that's because today's
supposed to be special!

256
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,280
Noir, you doofus.

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,330
Sorry! I was just worried.

258
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,950
I've known you forever,
and you're important to me.

259
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,190
Just saying that I'm important
to you isn't enough!

260
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,150
Th-Then... can I hug you?

261
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,610
Sure...

262
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay... here I go.

263
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,190
Your scent is so calming.

264
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,660
Not to mention...

265
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Noir Stardia

266
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,420
A few hours prior

267
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,830
So, Olivia...

268
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,200
You hear somethin'?

269
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,840
M-Master...

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,050
Yes?

271
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,000
I was hoping I could make
a skill that would help me

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,930
with the Hero Academy exam.

273
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,090
This calls for cheating!

274
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,560
You're awful, you know that?

275
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,870
And you're too much of a goody two shoes.

276
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,460
That's exactly why they took your job.

277
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,610
It takes 300 LP to use,
but I've got just the skill for you.

278
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,900
You interested?

279
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,280
Yes, please!

280
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,280
In that case...

281
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:40,160
Discerning Eye

282
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:40,160
Have a peek into
information about any
living creature or object.

283
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,180
The skill that grants you a peek
into any kind of information:

284
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,010
The Discerning Eye!

285
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,290
With this, you're good to go on your exam!

286
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,500
Thanks, Emma.

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,630
It's fine. This is basically a greeting.

288
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,230
Okay, now to Get Creative and
create the Discerning Eye skill.

This means I'll pass for sure!

298
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,670
I need to make sure I thank Emma properly.

299
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,220
Man, my shoulders are so stiff.

300
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,730
My chest is way too heavy.

301
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,070
All right!

I'll use Get Creative and
give Emma Small Boobs.

305
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,060
I'll need a total of 80 LP to do this, but...

306
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,070
Needed to Get Creative          LP.30

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,310
There!

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,710
Wh-What just happened?!

309
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,320
Wh-What? Why?!

310
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,000
Now your shoulders won't be so stiff.

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,810
Don't worry, plenty of people
love small boobs. Isn't that great?

312
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,350
Are you being serious right now?

313
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,250
Yup!

314
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,430
Though I definitely prefer them big.

315
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,190
Gimme back my boobs, you doofus!

316
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,560
I ended up having to use Editor
to give her boobs back.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,940

00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,530
But of course.

321
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,480
Barons and viscounts...

322
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,910
They're totally different
from a baronet like me.

323
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,040
We will now begin the entrance exam.

324
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,330
Your task is to collect raw
materials from monsters.

325
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,300
You'll be judged on how much you bring
in and how rare the materials are.

326
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,430
This will be a team effort in which
you split up into groups of three.

327
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,920
Return empty-handed, and you fail!

328
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,800
That is all!

329
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
We have to make a team?

330
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,570
No one told us that before.

331
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,330
I'd better hurry up and find people.

332
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,580
E-Excuse me. Would you like to...

333
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,200
Hm? You reek of baronet stench.

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,540
Um...

335
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,610
Yeah, I don't associate with trash.

336
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,750
Trash, huh?

337
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,420
Hey, wanna team up?

338
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,740
Heya, Noir!

339
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,380
E-Emma? What are you doing here?

340
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,240
What about your librarian job?

341
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,430
I quit. I figured I'd give the
Hero Academy a shot, too.

342
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,560
I-I can't believe you quit that easily...

343
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,590
Well, I didn't get to be with you.

344
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,310
Huh?

345
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,940
Noir, you doofus. Come on, let's team up.

346
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,640
Hey, want to team up?

347
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,790
I'm Lenore Bludon.

348
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,490
You don't need to be formal with me.
The more casual, the better.

349
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,390
I'm Emma Brightness, my la... Lenore.

350
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,060
Brightness? Ah, a barony.

351
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,530
I'm Noir Stardia.

352
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,040
I didn't ask for your name.

353
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,570
Why would I bother remembering
the name of a baronet?

354
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,380
Huh?

355
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,580
Now, then...

356
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,110
Gather as many materials
as you can by noon tomorrow.

357
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,630
You can obtain them in any way you'd like.

358
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,770
Begin!

359
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,470
The marketplace!

360
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm buying everything!

361
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,910
Y-You can buy the materials, too?

362
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,650
I guess so. He never said you had to
actually defeat any monsters, so...

363
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,400
Let's split up.

364
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,740
Don't drag us down, Mr. Bottom
of the Aristocratic Food Chain.

365
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,350
I guess the rich definitely
have the upper hand.

366
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah...

367
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,700
What are you going to do, Noir?

368
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,630
If you're going to hunt for your
materials, I'll come with you.

369
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,100
No, you wait here, Emma.

370
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,520
I have an idea.

371
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,930
I was sure there'd be plenty of rare
monsters in a hidden dungeon.

372
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,390
And that's why I came to
the third floor, but...

373
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,850
Are you serious right now?!

374
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,370
I'm still level 23...

375
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,690
Dead Reaper Lv.99

376
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,690
Skill [Execution Slash]
Skill Any damage dealt to its enemy with the
Skill Scythe means Instant Death. Effect cannot
Skill be avoided without specific resistance.

377
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,960
Not to mention, if that Scythe hits me,
it's an insta-death for me.

378
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,330
I-If I use my Editor skill and
delete its Instant Death attack...

379
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,790
Skill [Execution Slash]

380
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,790
LP needed to delete: 4000

381
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Nope! I'd literally die eight times!

382
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:08,010
Noir Stardia

383
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,780
I created the skill Heavy
and Bestowed it on the Reaper.

384
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,900
I managed to stop it for now,

385
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,720
but that instantly cost me 200 LP...

386
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,380
I feel so weak...

387
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,790
I lost so much LP, I can actually
feel my life draining away...

388
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,460
But... I have to do this...

389
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,990
There's no other way!

390
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,500
I'll use 100 LP and my Editor skill to make
the Stone Bullet size 100 centimeters!

391
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,000
Stone Bullet

392
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,000
Noir Stardia

393
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,880
You know, you seem a bit thin.
Have you been eating properly?

394
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,330
Here. This should fill you up!

395
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,390
Stone Bullet 100!

396
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,730
Noir Stardia

397
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,730
I-I'm exhausted...

398
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,490
And now I will announce the top three
teams from the entrance exam results.

399
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,370
He hasn't called our team at all.

400
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,040
Y-Yeah...

401
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,210
In third place, Team Genos with 5,890 points.

402
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,070
In second place, Team Elizabeth
with 11,550 points.

403
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,310
H-He still hasn't called us.

404
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,430
Maybe we didn't even rank...

405
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,280
W-We should be okay.

406
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,060
I mean, Master said...

407
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,520
It wouldn't be weird if I brought
this to the exam, right?

408
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,230
Nah.

409
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,980
It's better than bringing a golden slime,
which doesn't exist on this continent.

410
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,110
They're grunts anyway, so you'll be fine.

411
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,210
B-But... if he doesn't call us...

412
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,840
And in first place...

413
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,460
Team Lenore with 128,000 points!

414
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,630
O-One hundred and twenty...

415
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,090
...eight thousand...

416
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,090
They had the skull of the extremely
diabolical Dead Reaper among their materials.

417
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,340
This means they pass and
rewrite history with that score.

418
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,390
Wh-What were you saying
about this being a grunt, Master?

419
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,290
Whoops, my bad.

420
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,240
A Dead Reaper is nothing to me,

421
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,190
but I guess a student hunting
them would be a miracle.

422
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,500
Well, whatever.

423
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,450
And so, I safely passed the exam
for the Hero Academy.

424
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,460
My family was ecstatic, and this
brightened everyone's moods.

425
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,480
That is, until we saw the enrollment fee.

426
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,160
Three hundred thousand rels?

427
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,960
How am I supposed to get that kind of money?

428
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,270
Next time, "The Guild and the Receptionist."

429
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,980
#02 "The Guild and the Receptionist"

430
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,730
